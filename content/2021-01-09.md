# Markdown examples

On top of plain Markdown, [Markdown Extra](https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra) adds support for footnotes, abbreviations, definition lists, tables, `class` and `id` attributes, fenced code blocks, and Markdown inside HTML blocks.

Additionally, images are properly enclosed in figure elements (with optional figcaption), and the `loading="lazy"` attribute is added.
