# Hello, World!

A **"Hello, World!" program** generally is a [computer program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program "Computer program") that outputs or displays the message "Hello, World!". Such a program is very simple in most [programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language "Programming language"), and is often used to illustrate the basic [syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax "Syntax") of a programming language. It is often the first program written by people learning to code.[^1] It can also be used as a [sanity test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanity_test "Sanity test") to make sure that a computer language is correctly installed, and that the operator understands how to use it.
